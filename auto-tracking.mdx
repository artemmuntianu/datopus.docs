Any website or web app can be decomposed into a set of features. A feature can consist of other features and/or controls, such as buttons, forms, links, etc.

Datopus watches for any activity happening inside a specific HTML element that marked with a special tag `[data-ds-feature=name]`. You should define this HTML element yourself, and it should represent a feature in your app or website.

```javascript HTML
<div data-ds-feature="Dashboard">
  ...
</div>
```

Tracker looks at all the smaller parts within a marked element and records what they do. These events include clicks, mouse movements, form submissions, or any other user interactions within that designated area.
